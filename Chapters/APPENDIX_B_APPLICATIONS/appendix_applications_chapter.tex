\chapter{Applications}
\label{chap:applications}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

To provide further examples and give the reader an idea of the scope of computations \hp3D is suitable for, this chapter briefly summarizes applications that have been implemented within the current version of the \hp3D finite element code. If an implementation is available in the public repository, we provide a file path for the interested user. References for further reading are provided in all cases.

\section{Optical Fiber Amplifier}
\label{sec:laser}

Fiber amplifiers are optical waveguides made of silica glass designed for power-scaling highly-coherent laser light. At high optical intensities, undesired nonlinear effects may negatively affect the beam quality. \hp3D has been used to study such nonlinear effects (e.g.~the interplay between the propagating electromagnetic fields and thermal effects) for active gain fiber amplifiers based on a finite element model of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations coupled with the heat equation \cite{henneking2021fiber,nagaraj2018raman}. An implementation of this application is available in the \file{problems/LASER/} directory. 

In addition to the coupled multiphysics formulation, the application employs a high-order discretization and anisotropic adaptive refinements \cite{henneking2021pollution} for a hybrid mesh consisting of both prismatic and hexahedral elements with curvilinear geometry. The application also served as the first real testbed problem for large-scale computation with the MPI/OpenMP parallel \hp3D code, successfully scaling up to thousands of wavelengths and $\sim$1B degrees of freedom \cite{henneking2021phd,henneking2022parallel}. The DPG FE implementation of the Maxwell equations also features fast integration routines via sum factorization for both hexahedral and prismatic elements \cite{mora2019fast,badger2020fast}.

\section{Adaptive Solution of High-Frequency Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering}
\label{sec:adaptive}

Accurate and efficient numerical simulations of wave propagation phenomena are very crucial in numerous engineering and physics applications, such as non-destructive testing, plasma fusion, modeling of meta-materials and biomedical and radar imaging. With traditional discretization methods, these simulations are extremely challenging due to two major issues: instability and indefiniteness of the linear systems. Consequently, common cutting-edge elliptic solvers simply break down. The DPG method overcomes both issues. As a non-standard minimum residual method, it promises high accuracy, unconditional stability and definite linear systems.

This work implemented a novel multigrid solver within \hp3D for linear systems arising from DPG discretizations with a special focus in acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation problems. The construction is heavily based on the attractive properties of the DPG method, but also on well-established theory of Schwarz domain decomposition and multigrid methods. As it is showcased in \cite{petrides2019phd,petrides2021adaptive,petrides2017adaptive}, the method is stable and reliable, and it is suitable for adaptive $hp$-meshes. The solver works hand-in-glove with the built-in DPG error indicator to drive adaptive mesh refinements. Integrating the iterative solver with the adaptive refinement procedure enables efficient and accurate solutions to challenging problems in the high-frequency regime. A distributed parallel version of the DPG multigrid solver is currently under development and will be discussed in a future version of the user manual; the technology is also described detail in \cite{hpbook3}.
