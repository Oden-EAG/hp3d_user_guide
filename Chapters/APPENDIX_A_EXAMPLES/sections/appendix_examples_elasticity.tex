\section{Linear Elasticity Problems}
\label{sec:elasticity}

%\subsection{Galerkin implementation}
%\label{subsec:elasticity-galerkin}

Linear elasticity will be added in a future version of the user manual.

%The general structure of the \file{ELASTICITY} application directory is similar to the implementation of previously discussed applications. This section only focuses on the specific aspects of implementing particular formulations of linear elasticity. We encourage reading Section~\ref{sec:poisson} on Poisson problems for additional discussion of problem implementations, in general.
