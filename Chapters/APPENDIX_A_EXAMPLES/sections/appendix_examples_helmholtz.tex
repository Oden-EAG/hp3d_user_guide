\section{Helmholtz Problems}
\label{sec:helmholtz}

%\subsection{Galerkin implementation}
%\label{subsec:helmholtz-galerkin}

Helmholtz (linear acoustics) will be added in a future version of the user manual.

%The general structure of the \file{HELMHOLTZ} application directory is similar to the implementation of previously discussed applications. This section only focuses on the specific aspects of implementing particular formulations of the Helmholtz problem. We encourage reading Section~\ref{sec:poisson} on Poisson problems for additional discussion of problem implementations, in general.
