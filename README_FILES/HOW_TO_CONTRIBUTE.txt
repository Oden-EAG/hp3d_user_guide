1) LaTeX Document:

 a) Removed dependency on external files. Currently using a default LaTeX book template which will need to be refined and customized (not a priority at the moment--focus on content instead). Assume that formatting will change substantially before publication (font type, size, margins, etc.).

 b) Please FOLLOW CONVENTIONS for keeping the document hierarchy consistent and simplify merging content later on. Conventions are detailed in README-FILES/CONVENTIONS.txt

 c) Preamble files are available -- please only modify own files (e.g., preamble_leszek.tex) custom newcommand, etc., but discuss adding new packages before doing so because of compatibility issues. Do not overwrite existing commands (had to merge conventions of different preamble definitions already -- curl/tcurl).

 d) Figure directory. Avoid including large file sizes (aim for figures with vector graphics with < 1 MB file size).
